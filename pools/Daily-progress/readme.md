## What I Did Yesterday
Focused on sourcing datasets for pools in Berlin to support the data modeling process.

## Successes
Collected multiple datasets on Berlin’s pools from various sources, including:
Baederleben.de

## Key findings from the compiled data:

144 total pools/swimming locations in Berlin

67 operated as pool facilities:

38 indoor swimming halls

29 outdoor/summer pools

Remaining sites are open water swimming locations (Badestellen)

Update frequency: Annually

Data type: Static

## Blockers
Difficulty obtaining open-source data in a downloadable format

## What I’m Working On Today
Continue with data processing and begin the modeling phase.
