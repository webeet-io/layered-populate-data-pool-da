This Python script collects event data from all repositories associated with a GitHub user account using the GitHub API. It extracts various event types (pushes, pull requests, issues, etc.), processes the data, and saves it to both CSV and JSON formats for analysis.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6+

GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions

Required Python packages:

pandas

PyGithub

Installation
Install required packages:

bash
pip install pandas PyGithub
Set up GitHub Personal Access Token:

Usage
Run the script directly:


The script will:

Authenticate with GitHub using your PAT

Fetch all repositories associated with your account

Collect events from each repository

Process and structure the event data

Save the data to timestamped CSV and JSON files

Display a summary of collected data

Data Collected
The script extracts the following information from GitHub events:

Event metadata: ID, type, and timestamp

Repository information: Name and full name

User information: ID, username, and type

Payload details:

Action type (for PRs, issues, etc.)

Commit count and messages (truncated to 100 characters)

Reference information (branches, tags)

Pull request titles and IDs

Release names

Comment bodies

Output Files
The script generates two output files with timestamps in the filename:

CSV file: github_events_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv

JSON file: github_events_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json

Rate Limiting
The script includes a small delay (0.1 seconds) between repository requests to respect GitHub's API rate limits and avoid being throttled.

Error Handling
The script includes comprehensive error handling for:

Authentication failures

Repository access issues

Individual event processing errors

Example Output
After running, the script will display:

Total events collected

Number of repositories processed

Unique event types found

A sample of the collected data

Use Cases
This data can be used for:

Analyzing development activity patterns

Monitoring repository engagement

Tracking contribution metrics

Auditing and compliance reporting

Visualizing project activity over time

Limitations
The GitHub API only returns events from the past 90 days

Rate limits may affect data collection for accounts with many repositories

Some event types may have varying payload structures
