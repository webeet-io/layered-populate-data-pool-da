## 🧩 2. Modelling & Planning

### 📌 Key Parameters Selected
We focused on columns covering:  
- Listing details (e.g., price, availability, room type)  
- Host information (e.g., host IDs, listing counts)  
- Neighborhood and district details  
- Reviews and ratings (including detailed review scores)  
- Location coordinates and geometry data  

### 🔗 Data Relationships
- Listings are linked to neighborhoods via the `neighborhood` column.  
- Hosts are uniquely identified by `host_id`.  
- Geospatial information is represented by `latitude`, `longitude`, and the `geometry` column for spatial analysis.  

### 📝 Planned Schema
The schema is designed to:  
- Capture core listing attributes and pricing  
- Normalize host-related data for consistency  
- Reference neighborhoods to maintain data integrity  
- Incorporate geospatial data to enable location-based analysis and visualization

## ⚠️ 4. Known Issues

- Missing or inconsistent data in review scores and price fields.
  
- bathrooms_text values like 'Half-bath' or 'Shared half-bath' required manual conversion, which assumes all such entries equal 0.5 — this may oversimplify nuanced cases.


---

## 🧹 5. Data Cleaning and Transformation

- Prices cleaned by removing currency symbols and commas, then converted to float.

- Text columns cleaned for consistent capitalization and removal of special characters.

- Amenities remain as raw strings and can be parsed into lists for detailed feature analysis.

- Bathroom information cleaned by extracting numeric values from the bathrooms_text column:

    - Parsed values like '2.5 baths' into 2.5.

    - Detected case-insensitive 'half' (e.g., 'Half-bath', 'Shared half-bath') and mapped them to 0.5.

    - Converted the result to a numeric bathrooms column and dropped the original bathrooms_text.
      
    - Created a new 'is_shared' column to indicate shared bathrooms:

    - Applied a case-insensitive search for the word 'shared' in bathrooms_text.

    - Assigned 1 if shared, 0 if private, and pd.NA if the data was missing or not a string.
      
- Standardized `neighbourhood_group_cleansed`:

    - Stripped extra white spaces to ensure clean matching.

    - Applied a mapping dictionary to rename values to human-readable and standardized district names (e.g., 'Charlottenburg-Wilm.' → 'Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf').

    - Renamed the column to `district` for simplicity and clarity.
    
    - Added `district_id` column (Foreign Key)

## 🛠️ 6. Database Integration

### 📥 Populate Database

- Used the approved SQL script to insert the transformed dataset into the database.
  
- Created new tables or updated existing ones according to the defined schema.
  
- Established primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships between:
  
   - Listings and neighborhoods via the `neighborhood` column.
     
   - Listings and districts via the `district_id` column.
  
- Verified data integrity through test queries and cross-referenced values.
