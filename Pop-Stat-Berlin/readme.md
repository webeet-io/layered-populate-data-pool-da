üîÑ Transformation Plan


1. Load & Normalize:


    *  Import CSV files into dataframes.


    *  Normalize all column headers.


2. Unpivot Age/Nationality Columns:


    *  Reshape wide age/nationality columns into long format (age_group, nationality)


3. Join Mapping Tables:


    *  Primary Join Field: Neighbourhood(matching neighborhood or district name in listings dataset) and postcode.


4. Standardize Columns:


    *  Rename columns consistently.


    *  Convert types (e.g., integers, strings).


5. Deduplicate:


    *  Remove total rows or repeated counts.


6. Save Cleaned File:


    *  Output as CSV  under a transformed/ directory for loading.
