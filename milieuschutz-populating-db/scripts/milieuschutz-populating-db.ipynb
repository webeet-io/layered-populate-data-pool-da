    "### 🎯 **What We'll Do in This Step:**\n",
    "Learn how to create secure database connections and handle connection parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 **Key Concepts You'll Learn:**\n",
    "1. **Connection Strings** - How to format PostgreSQL URLs\n",
    "2. **Environment Variables** - Secure way to store credentials\n",
    "3. **Connection Testing** - Verify database connectivity\n",
    "4. **Error Handling** - What to do when connections fail\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Database Connection Components:**\n",
    "- **Host**: Where your PostgreSQL server is running (localhost, IP, or domain)\n",
    "- **Port**: Usually 5432 for PostgreSQL\n",
    "- **Database**: Name of your specific database\n",
    "- **Username/Password**: Your credentials\n",
    "- **PostGIS**: Spatial extension that must be enabled\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔒 **Security Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Never hardcode passwords in notebooks\n",
    "- Use environment variables or config files\n",
    "- Test connections before proceeding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **What This Step Accomplishes:**\n",
    "- Create a connection string template\n",
    "- Test database connectivity\n",
    "- Handle connection errors gracefully\n",
    "- Prepare for schema creation\n",
