S-Bahn Berlin Data Modelling

1.1 Data Source Discovery

Source: Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (VBB) GTFS dataset
Origin: Berlin Open Data Portal
License: Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)
Update frequency: Twice per week (Wednesday, Friday)
Data type: Dynamic (GTFS format, regularly updated)

The GTFS dataset includes:

All public transport stops (S-Bahn, U-Bahn, buses, trams, ferries)
Route definitions
Timetables
Shape files for routes
Transfers and pathways
1.2 Modelling & Planning

Relevant columns for S-Bahn stations (from GTFS stops.txt and related files):

stop_id
stop_name
stop_lat
stop_lon
location_type
parent_station
Route mapping from routes.txt and trips.txt
Planned table: sbahn_stations
Fields:

stop_id (PK)
stop_name
line[] (array of S-Bahn lines serving the station)
latitude
longitude
postcode
stadtteil
fkdistrict (FK â†’ districts.pkdistrict)
Connections to existing database:

fkdistrict links to districts table via district ID
Latitude/longitude match existing geospatial queries
Postcode and neighborhood can connect to listings & neighborhoods datasets
Known data issues:

Mixed data types in trips.txt and stop_times.txt
Duplicate station names (different lines)
Missing postcode for some stops
Some stops may appear in multiple datasets (U-Bahn + S-Bahn)
Transformation plan:

Filter only S-Bahn stops from GTFS using route_id and agency information
Join with trips and routes to extract served lines
Remove duplicates, standardize names
Enrich with postcode, stadtteil, and fkdistrict
Save cleaned data to /sources/sbahn_stations_clean.csv
1.3 Sources Directory

Files in /sources:

sbahn_stations.csv: raw extracted S-Bahn stations
sbahn_stations_clean.csv: cleaned and enriched dataset
