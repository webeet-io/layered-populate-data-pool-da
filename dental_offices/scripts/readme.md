The script begins by loading a CSV file containing information about dental offices in Berlin and performs thorough data cleaning and normalization. Initial exploratory steps involve inspecting the dataset structure and previewing sample records. Text fields—including dental office name, street address, house number, city, and postcode—are standardized for consistent capitalization and formatting. The street and house number fields are combined into a single full address string for easier reference.
To maintain data quality, duplicate entries are removed based on the combination of name and full address. Phone numbers are normalized by removing spaces and hyphens, while the wheelchair accessibility field is standardized to lowercase and missing values are set to “unknown.” Latitude and longitude coordinates are validated and converted to numeric types, with records lacking valid location data excluded from further processing.
Next, the cleaned dental office dataset is enriched by spatially joining it with Berlin district boundary polygons loaded from a GeoJSON file. This spatial join assigns each dentist record to its corresponding Berlin district based on geographic location, effectively merging administrative district data with the original dental office data.
The resulting GeoDataFrame undergoes column renaming and pruning to streamline and clarify the dataset. The final cleaned and augmented dataset is saved as a CSV file, providing a well-structured, deduplicated, and geographically enriched resource that is ready for downstream analysis or visualization.
