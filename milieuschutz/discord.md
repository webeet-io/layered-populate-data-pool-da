Dear <@&1378909011369398416> ,

I see you working with your pull requests and progressing through your tasks — great job so far! I truly appreciate the hard work and effort you're putting in.
Here are a few important reminders to help us stay aligned and collaborate more effectively:

🔹 **1. Use “neighborhoods” as the unifying column**
While "district" may be more official (e.g., in a city name), “neighborhood” is more intuitive and user-friendly. Most users think in terms of neighborhoods, not districts — and not all cities have districts, but nearly all have neighborhoods. So moving forward, let’s standardize on "neighborhoods".

🔹 **2. Do not delete original folders when copying main**
When you create your branch from main, remember:
If folders already exist, they likely contain someone else's work.
Do not delete or overwrite them.
Instead, add your new folder or layer on top. Think of it as adding a new layer, not replacing what's already there.

🔹 **3. Read the issues carefully**
Each issue includes detailed instructions:
- How to name your branch
- What steps to follow
- Which directory and files to use
Issues are your roadmap. They exist to make your work easier and more structured. Please follow them closely.

**🔹 4. Always fetch before pushing changes or submitting a pull request**
Before committing your changes or creating a pull request:
- Run `git fetch` and` git pull` to get the latest from main.
Why? Because other teammates may have merged their changes already, and your branch could become outdated or cause conflicts.
Keeping your branch synced with main ensures smoother merges and fewer issues.

Thanks again for your dedication and teamwork. 🚀
