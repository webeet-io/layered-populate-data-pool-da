# Git Workflow Guide 🚀

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for common Git operations in your data analysis project.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Make sure you're in the project directory: `/Users/zeal.v/Help/layered-populate-data-pool-da`
- Ensure you're on the correct branch: `milieuschutz-data-transformation-v3`

## 🔄 Complete Git Workflow (Pull → Add → Commit → Push)

### 1. Check Current Status
```bash
git status
```
This shows you:
- Which branch you're on
- Files that have been modified
- Files that are staged for commit
- Untracked files

### 2. Pull Latest Changes (Always Do This First!)
```bash
git pull origin milieuschutz-data-transformation-v3
```
**Why this is important:**
- Synchronizes your local repository with the remote
- Prevents merge conflicts
- Ensures you're working with the latest code

### 3. Add Changes to Staging Area
```bash
# Add all files (recommended for data projects)
git add .

# OR add specific files
git add path/to/specific/file.extension
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message

- Brief description of what was changed
- List major additions or modifications
- Include any important notes"
```

**Good commit message examples:**
- ✅ `"Add WFS data transformation notebook and clean CSV exports"`
- ✅ `"Update milieuschutz analysis with new visualization charts"`
- ✅ `"Fix data type conversion issues in area calculations"`

**Bad commit message examples:**
- ❌ `"update"`
- ❌ `"fix"`
- ❌ `"changes"`

### 5. Push to Remote Repository
```bash
git push origin milieuschutz-data-transformation-v3
```

## 🚨 Emergency Commands

### Check Remote Status
```bash
git remote -v
```

### See Commit History
```bash
git log --oneline
```

### Unstage Files (if you added wrong files)
```bash
git restore --staged <file>
```

### Undo Last Commit (but keep changes)
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Force Pull (if you have conflicts)
```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/milieuschutz-data-transformation-v3
```
⚠️ **Warning:** This will overwrite your local changes!

## 📝 Best Practices for Data Projects

### 1. **Always Pull First**
```bash
git pull origin milieuschutz-data-transformation-v3
```

### 2. **Commit Often, Push Regularly**
- Commit after completing a logical unit of work
- Push at least once per day
- Don't wait until you have "perfect" code

### 3. **Use Descriptive Commit Messages**
- Start with a verb (Add, Update, Fix, Remove)
- Be specific about what changed
- Include context for data files

### 4. **Check Status Before and After**
```bash
# Before making changes
git status

# After adding files
git status

# After committing
git status
```

   git status
   ```

2. **Work on your notebooks/data files**
   - Edit Jupyter notebooks
   - Generate new CSV/JSON files
   - Create visualizations

3. **Save your progress:**

   git status  # Make sure everything is committed
   ```

## 🆘 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Your branch is behind"
**Solution:**
```bash
git pull origin milieuschutz-data-transformation-v3
```

### Issue: "Merge conflicts"
**Solution:**
1. Open conflicted files
2. Resolve conflicts manually
3. Add and commit the resolved files

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure you're authenticated with GitHub

git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You know everything worked when you see:
- ✅ `Already up to date.` (after pull)
- ✅ `[branch-name commit-id] commit message` (after commit)
- ✅ `To https://github.com/...` (after push)

Perfect! You're absolutely right to understand the difference.

# Question July 2, 10:32- Quick summary of what's happening:
✅ Cache folder is NOT being tracked by git (which is what you wanted)
✅ Green color in VS Code = untracked files (normal behavior)
✅ Gray color would mean ignored via .gitignore (different approach)

You achieved your goal of keeping the cache folder out of git without modifying .gitignore. The green color is just VS Code's way of showing "this exists locally but isn't tracked by git."

Thanks for the great question - understanding the difference between untracked vs ignored files is really important for git workflows! 🚀
